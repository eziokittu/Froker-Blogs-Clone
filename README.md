# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

<h1>Steps to run the website</h1><br>
<ol>
  <li>open 2 terminal windows</li>
  <li>In the first one write the commands one by one</li>
    <ul>
      <li>cd client</li>
      <li>npm install</li>
      <li>npm run dev</li>
    </ul>
  <li>In the second terminal write these one by one</li>
    <ul>
      <li>cd server</li>
      <li>npm install</li>
      <li>npm start</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Now both the client and server will be running. So open "http://localhost:5173" in any browser</li>
  <li>This will take you to the home page of the website which will redirect to the blogs page in 6 seconds</li>
</ol> 

<p>Thank you for your patience in the above steps. Sorry, I was not able to host. Since I was getting BUILD ERRORS on both NETLIFY and RENDER hosting platforms. So please run locally by following the above steps.</p>
<p>Look into the screenshots folder for the various screenshots taken from the website, if for some reason, you are not able to run the project.</p>
<p>The database is in MONGODB ATLAS in my own account. So there should be no issues in fetching the blogs data using the API calls to the backend</p>
<p>Also, the ".env" files are made available and not hidden using .gitignore since the website is not hosted yet. So that other people can stick to the available environment variables</p>

<br><h1>Thank You for your time!</h1>
